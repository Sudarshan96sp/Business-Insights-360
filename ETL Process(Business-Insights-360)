📌 ETL Process for Business Insights 360
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Process Documentation

📌 Step 1: Extract (E) - Data Collection
Data Sources:
MySQL Database → Extracted data using SQL queries.
Excel Files → Sales_Data.xlsx, Customer_Data.xlsx.
CSV Files → Product_Data.csv.
Data Extraction Methods:
SQL Queries (MySQL) → Pull relevant sales, customer, and product data.
Power Query (Excel/Power BI) → Import data from Excel and CSV files.
📌 Step 2: Transform (T) - Data Cleaning & Processing
Data Cleaning Steps:
✅ Remove duplicates from imported data.
✅ Handle missing values (e.g., filling NULLs with default values or averages).
✅ Convert data types (e.g., Date fields converted to date format, numerical values cleaned).
✅ Standardize column names (e.g., Customer_ID, Product_ID, Total_Sales).

Data Transformation Steps:
✔ Create calculated columns (e.g., Total Sales = Quantity × Unit Price).
✔ Aggregate data by Region, Product, and Customer for insights at different levels.
✔ Join tables using common fields like Customer_ID, Product_ID to merge datasets.
✔ Apply business rules like Gross Margin % calculation and other metrics.

📌 Step 3: Load (L) - Data Storage
Destination:
Power BI Data Model → For creating interactive dashboards and reports.
SQL Database → Storing cleaned and transformed data for further use.
Excel/CSV Export → For exporting clean data for external analysis or sharing.
Loading Methods:
📌 Power BI Import Mode → Data is imported into Power BI for fast performance.
📌 Power BI DirectQuery Mode → For live data connections and updates.
📌 Scheduled Refresh → Automating data refresh in Power BI Service to keep reports up-to-date.

📌 Additional Considerations
📌 Data Refresh Frequency: Data is refreshed on a scheduled basis to ensure up-to-date reporting.
📌 Data Validation Checks: Perform regular checks to validate transformations and calculations.
📌 Error Handling: Log any issues with data extraction or transformation for debugging and improvements.

📌 How to Update ETL Process?
1️⃣ Modify SQL queries or Power Query steps to handle new data or transformations.
2️⃣ Validate transformed data to ensure quality.
3️⃣ Load updated data into Power BI using the defined methods.
4️⃣ Set up Scheduled Refresh to automate future data updates in Power BI Service.
